        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I am a versatile creative professional with a passion for visual storytelling and digital artistry. My expertise spans across video editing, photo manipulation, and animation, allowing me to bring a unique and comprehensive approach to every project.
        </p>
        <p>Video Editor<br/>

            As a video editor, I am skilled in assembling recorded raw material into a coherent and polished final product. My process involves selecting shots, trimming segments, arranging footage, adding transitions, and incorporating sound effects, music, and graphics. I work with industry-standard video editing software such as Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, and DaVinci Resolve to ensure the highest quality outcomes.</p>
  <p>Photoshop Specialist<br/>

    I am proficient in using Photoshop, Adobe's powerful graphic design and photo editing software. My work includes retouching photos, creating digital artwork, and designing graphics for both web and print. With Photoshop, I can manipulate images to perfection, whether it's for enhancing photographs or crafting intricate digital compositions.</p>
    <p>Animator<br/>

        As an animator, I create multiple images, known as frames, that give the illusion of movement when displayed in rapid sequence. My animation work spans various mediums, including 2D animation, 3D animation, and stop-motion. I utilize software like Adobe Animate, Blender, and Toon Boom Harmony to produce animations for films, TV shows, video games, and other multimedia platforms.</p>
    <p>
        Combining these skills, I strive to bring creativity and precision to every project, delivering compelling visual content that captivates and engages audiences.
